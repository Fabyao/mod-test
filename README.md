# Angular Competency Test By Fabrice Yao

Please follow the instructions below to run the project:
* run "npm install"
* Ensure MongoDB is waiting for connections
* run "npm start". This should get the application running on port 8080. If port 8080 is in use, please change the port number in "server/config/server.js"
* The default URL will be http://localhost:8080
* To run Angular unit tests, "npm run angular-tests"
* To run integration tests, "npm test"

Should you need to contact me for further details, please email me <fabriceyao@hotmail.com>

I look forward to seeing the feedback.
